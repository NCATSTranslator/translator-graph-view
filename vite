▲ [WARNING] The condition "types" here will never be used as it comes after both "import" and "require" [package.json]

    package.json:13:6:
      13 │       "types": "./dist/index.d.ts"
         ╵       ~~~~~~~

  The "import" condition comes earlier and will be used for all "import" statements:

    package.json:11:6:
      11 │       "import": "./dist/index.js",
         ╵       ~~~~~~~~

  The "require" condition comes earlier and will be used for all "require" calls:

    package.json:12:6:
      12 │       "require": "./dist/index.cjs",
